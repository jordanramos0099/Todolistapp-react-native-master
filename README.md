# Todo List App

This is a simple todo list app built using React Native and its components for the UI.

The project was developed as part of my journey to learn React Native. I closely followed Maximilian Schwarzmüller's comprehensive course [React Native - The Practical Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide) on Udemy to build this app.
